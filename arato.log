[2023-12-24 15:34:45] Yo it's the captain speaking. For this script's maiden voyage I'm going to perform a sequence of the same experiment with three different strategies, repeating each one three times. First I'll try to tune out any conscious thought processes and just look at the list of training strings in zen mode as if taking in a modern piece of art. I will do this twice more. Second I'm going to try to work out the underlying regular grammar in my head without external aids, again repeat twice more. In the final round of experiments I will attempt to reconstruct the underlying grammar with pencil and paper. All other parameters of the experimental procedure shall be kept the same throughout.
[2023-12-24 15:34:45] I feel adequately well rested and only a little thristy. I'm on the highway with my mom driving, it's quiet and my ability to concentrate is not impaired in any way.
[2023-12-24 15:34:45] Let's go!
[2023-12-24 15:34:45] The training phase will now begin. You will have 180 seconds to study a list of 20 exemplars of the hidden grammar.
[2023-12-24 15:34:45] Please make sure your screen and terminal font are comfortable to read. Press return when you are ready.
[2023-12-24 15:34:52] Training phase started. Please study the following list of strings:

[2023-12-24 15:41:50] Honestly I'm a little surprised that I performed above chance, I felt like I had no idea what I was doing. Is this what implicit learning is supposed to feel like?

[2023-12-24 15:54:25] I forgot to declare in the first session that I'm not looking at the correct answers because I want to try to figure out the exact same grammars in the latter two phases.
[2023-12-24 15:54:25] That said this particular grammar feels pretty deficient or perverted, the training set featured no V's or X's and most strings seemed to have a length of eight.
[2023-12-24 15:54:25] Btw I'm finding it a bit hard to fully shut down all conscious analysis, it goes to show how much the human mind loves to latch onto patterns and try to squeeze conjectures from them. Every time I feel like I'm falling into a rhythm of comparing similar training strings or noting what seem like obvious loops in the grammar I tell myself to stop, but it does not feel like I'm fully in control of the process.

[2023-12-24 19:11:46] Last "no thinking" session. Sitting in a stationary car now a few hours later. No distractions at the moment.
[2023-12-24 19:11:46] I gotta go to the john soon though.
[2023-12-24 19:11:46] The training phase will now begin. You will have 180 seconds to study a list of 20 exemplars of the hidden grammar.
[2023-12-24 19:11:46] Please make sure your screen and terminal font are comfortable to read. Press return when you are ready.

[2023-12-25 20:42:16] Okay, time for the second batch of tests with the same three grammars as before. I had a good night's sleep and a glass of wine earlier in the day, about three hours ago.
[2023-12-25 20:42:16] I remember the second grammar producing mostly strings of length 8 and some letters were missing. The last grammar excluded M's if I'm not mistaken. I don't seem to recall much else about them.
[2023-12-25 20:42:16] I am home alone (yes, it's Christmas), a tiny bit tired, free of distractions.
[2023-12-25 20:42:16] I expect my performance to improve considerably compared to the "no thinking" phase.
[2023-12-25 20:42:16] The training phase will now begin. You will have 180 seconds to study a list of 20 exemplars of the hidden grammar.

[2023-12-25 21:00:21] I have an inkling that something might be off with the part of the script sorting the stimuli into training and test sets because the training set seemed much more strict than the test set.
[2023-12-25 21:00:21] I arrived at the grammar (M*(SR*))* in less than a minute but it seemed strange that no MMMM or similar output was included in the training set. I might be wrong about the solution though -- which is likely looking at my final score.

[2023-12-25 21:03:57] You may type 'y' for yes (i.e. grammatical) and 'n' for no (ungrammatical). Press return when you are ready.

[2023-12-25 21:12:47] I'm starting to think that maybe the only reason I seem to be performing above chance is because I know that the number of bad test stimuli is exactly half, which obviously gives me a small statistical edge compared to a truly arbitrary test set. Maybe I should hide the exact number of grammatical and ungrammatical test strings from the user, that would be more fair.
[2023-12-25 21:12:47] I suspect that people tacitly suppose that they are getting a (close to) 50-50 mix of good and bad test strings and therefore unintentionally exploit this statistical "knowledge" to beat the 50% baseline.

[2023-12-25 22:12:14] Done.
[2023-12-25 22:12:14] You may add any notes or comments for the record before the training phase begins (optional). Please enter an empty line when you're done:
[2023-12-25 22:17:18] Okay, I checked and it turns out you get no statistical edge from knowing or assuming an equal 50-50 distribution of good and bad test items whatsoever. So it looks like I am picking up on something after all.
[2023-12-25 22:17:18] Doing the last batch of experiments tonight because I need to look after some pets tomorrow. I still feel relatively comfortable, same setting as before: at home, no one to distract me. I have paper and pencil ready.
[2023-12-25 22:17:18] Before the previous batch of experiments (try to work the grammar out but no aids) my expectation for this last phase would have been to crush the game with a score of 90% or better. Now that I have a little bit of actual experience with the task I expect to perform somewhere around 80%.
[2023-12-25 22:17:18] The training phase will now begin. You will have 180 seconds to study a list of 20 exemplars of the hidden grammar.

[2023-12-25 22:27:08] It's pretty clear that I have no idea what I'm doing. I got six states in my doodle but I'm pretty sure some of them should be merged and I may well have missed one or two more. Basically I got an M(XV) path, an SSX path that leads back to the starting state and an S(RS) path but I have very low confidence in all of it.

[2023-12-25 22:51:09] Yup, pretty bad. I scribbled down the following:
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 1 -R-> 1
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 1 -V-> 2
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 2 -S-> 2
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 2 -V-> 3
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 3 -V-> 3
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 3 -R-> 4
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 4 -R-> 4
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 2 -R-> 4
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] 4 -X-> 2
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] ...and all states looked fine to halt in except number 1.
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] Overall this strategy feels like a dramatic failure and it seems obvious that one cannot expect to beat the game by a large margin even with pen and paper.
[2023-12-25 22:51:09] I'm going to look at the actual grammars now and see if I was anywhere close. Over and out.
